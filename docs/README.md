# Financial Market Forecasting 
(Multivariate Time Series Analysis)

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to harness the power of machine learning and deep learning to predict stock prices amidst the volatile nature of financial markets. By employing Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM), we aim to forecast the stock trends of various banks under Bank Nifty, thereby aiding investors in making informed decisions.

## Overview
Financial markets are highly susceptible to a myriad of geopolitical changes. Recent events like the COVID-19 pandemic have showcased the unpredictable impact on stock prices. Reliable trend analysis on financial data has thus become a challenging task. This project endeavors to address this issue by employing machine learning and deep learning techniques, particularly focusing on time series forecasting using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and LSTM.

## Concepts Utilized
- **Time Series Analysis:** Time series data, recorded at regular intervals, is crucial as the order of data points significantly impacts the predictive modeling. The essence of time is captured as an independent variable in our models to predict or classify values at specific times.
- **Multivariate Time Series Forecasting:** Utilizing multiple variables to forecast stock prices, enhancing the predictive accuracy of the model.
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM):** Leveraging RNNs and LSTM known for their ability to remember previous inputs in predicting the future stock prices.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Scikit-Learn
  - TensorFlow
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - Plotly
  - yfinance

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing:** 
   - The stock price data over a period of three years is collected and preprocessed to ensure quality and consistency.
   - Missing values are handled, and data is normalized to prepare it for training.

2. **Visualizations:**
   - Initial data exploration is conducted using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to understand the trends and patterns in the data.

3. **Model Building:**
   - Various RNN and LSTM models are trained on the preprocessed data.
   - Hyperparameters are tuned to achieve better accuracy.

4. **Prediction:**
   - The trained models are used to predict the future stock prices of the banks under Bank Nifty.

5. **Result Visualization:**
   - The predictions are visualized and compared with the actual values to evaluate the performance of the models.

6. **Evaluation:**
   - Models are evaluated based on metrics like Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Squared Error, etc., to understand their predictive accuracy.

## Conclusions
The project demonstrates the potential of machine learning and deep learning in navigating the unpredictable waters of financial markets. The predictive models developed herein serve as a robust tool for investors, financial analysts, and other stakeholders in the financial ecosystem to make more informed decisions regarding their investments.

## Future Work
There's a scope for exploring other deep learning architectures and incorporating more features to further enhance the predictive capabilities of the model.
